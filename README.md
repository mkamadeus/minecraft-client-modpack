# My Personal Minecraft Modpack

![Minecraft](https://img.shields.io/badge/Minecraft-1.19.2-green?logo=minecraft)

### Aim

- Able to package mods and configurations that I commonly use across my systems for Minecraft.
- Able to play _in my way_ :) also adding some QOL changes to Minecraft that I think should be added.

### Mod List

You can check it out under `mods/`.
My chosen mods are a weird mix of QOL mods, optimization mods, and some technical mods.
Full list below:

- BetterF3
- Carpet Extra
- Carpet
- Cloth Config API (Fabric/Forge)
- Continuity
- DashLoader
- Fabric API
- Fabric Language Kotlin
- Indium
- Inventory Profiles Next
- Inventory Tabs (updated)
- Iris Shaders
- Item Scroller
- LambDynamicLights
- LazyDFU
- libIPN

### Using the Modpack

Currently haven't checked the licenses for each mod, so you'll have to build it manually for now:

```bash
make # will build for both CurseForge and Modrinth format
```
