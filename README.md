# My Personal Minecraft Modpack

![Minecraft](https://img.shields.io/badge/Minecraft-1.19.2-green?logo=minecraft)

### Aim

- Able to package mods and configurations that I commonly use across my systems for Minecraft.
- Able to play _in my way_ :) also adding some QOL changes to Minecraft that I think should be added.

### Using the Modpack

Currently haven't checked the licenses for each mod, so you'll have to build it manually for now:

```bash
make # will build for both CurseForge and Modrinth format
```

or simply...

```cmd
packwiz modrinth export
packwiz curseforge export
```
